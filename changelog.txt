# uBaldr Version 7.1.1

- changelog -

# New Functions:

> Changed the PiciWifi-Module to uWifi. Improved the code and changed the behavior:
    - To connect with a wifi, now a instance needs to be created with wifi = client(). You can call then the wifi.connect() Method to establish the connection.
    - It's now also possible to make the instance without having a JSON-Config-File. That makes the module usable in other projects

> Major-changes in logger-module:
    - In every module, an instance of logger is now created. To log an event, the log-mothod is called from this instance.
    Example:
        event = logger.Create('test', '/log/')
        event.log('I', 'This is a test')
    - This makes the logging more flexible and avoids mistakes in the code. 
    - There is also a Dummy_logger class if the logging is not used
    - The changes are applied to all modules, means that it is not downward-compatible!

> Major changes in NTP-Module:
    - Moved the functions to a class for better handling
    - Added the possibility to not use a JSON-Config file. The json_config_parser is only imported if JSON is used. This makes the module more flexible.

> Changes in json_config_parser:
    - Added Exeption for OS-Error and Option to create a new file in case, the wanted one does not exist: If this option is turned on, a new, empty JSON-File is created.
      The purpose of that is to make it possible to create new JSON-Config-Files. If the option is turned off, an Error is returned instead of crashing the program.

# Removed functions:


# Bugfixes:
    uWifi:
        - Added an exeption to the connect-function to avoid the program to exit if it tries to connect and wifi chip is noch active.

> Problem with NTP-Timestamp:
