# uBaldr Version 6.3.4

- changelog -

# New Functions:
> Added ESP-32 Support
	- Added 2 new items to config.json, "onboard_led" and "led_inverted" as the onboard_led is usually pin21 and also the value is inverted on ESP32-3

# Bugfixes:
> Corrected problem with wrong configured command-map in order.py
> Watchdog was not working proberly and lost network Connection was not detected every time. Also the reconnect to the MQTT-Broker did not work. This has been fixed
> Changed the network-check-function. Before it was a ping to the Google-DNS. Now it is more simplified:
	- The client sends an “echo” to the /status topic and waits for the response with wait_msg(). The program is paused until it receives a response from the broker.
	- It does not matter what is in the answer string. It continues when a message is received on the /order-topic. Will maybe improve this function later…
> In some cases Baldr was not able to connect to WiFi. You then had to power-cycle the device and it (usually) worked. The reason was that the wifi-chip was not yet ready when the Connection started. This has been fixed.
> Fixed the issue with importing typing module. The typing module is not supported in micropython. The reason for using typing was to avoid false error-messages in VS-Code  - Added #type:ignore comment on this lines as a workaround.
