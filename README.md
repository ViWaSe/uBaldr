# uBaldr
This is a Micropython Smarthome / IoT-project using Raspberry PicoW or ESP-32 microcontroller.

You can use this project to control Neopixel-LEDs via the MQTT-Protocoll. A MQTT-Broker is needed to run the project and can i.E. be realized by a Raspberry Pi.
JSON-Strings are used for communication (version >= 5.1j). Please see documentation for more info!

# Documentaion
I tried my best to write a documentation on how to use the project. Of course you should not copy the pdf to your µPython-Device ;).
Please let me know if you have questions / improvement suggestions or found bugs. 

Have fun!
